# Invoke The Warlocks (React App)

Invoke The Warlocks is a web application built using ReactJS. Users can generate Warlock player characters or non-player characters for use in the Dungeons and Dragons role playing game. Official Dungeons and Dragons content is licences under the Dungeons and Dragons open gaming licence version (OGL) and some content on this site is derived from or directly references the Dungeons and Dragons standard reference document (SRD) found [here](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf).

A live version of the app currently resides [here](https://www.invokethewarlock.com)
